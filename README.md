# RecipeApp
A recipe tracker that helps users track recipes built using the MERN stack.


# Description:
I had an Idea that I wanted to build out and I did it! 

I oftentimes find myself wondering what I'm closest to being able to make in the kitchen. You know, you've got some ingredients that are going to waste and you want to incorporate them into your next meal but can't seem to find a recipe that uses them? This app is a cool solution I thought of.

# Features:
Users can Add recipes that they love, Search for recipes they're closest to being able to make with the ingredients they have in their kitchen, and keep up with the recipes they've collected using the Recipe Book feature.

# Current Deployment: https://dylans-recipe-app.onrender.com/
